# One of first websites in react.

One of first websites in react made by me. This page imitate something like blog. It's in Polish because main goal was to create
sceleton of my dad website. I was trying to do something like blog for him but I conluded that it's not this.

# Motivation

My main purpose of made this website was develop more skill in <b>React</b> and try out some of my ideas. Mainly I was trying to 
create some animations that I created in websites based on HTML/JS. However I created many new animations. 

# About code

I used class components (because I didn't know about Hooks at that time). For styling - CSS. Class names in camel case. 

# About folder structure: 

- <b>images</b> - for store images
- <b>Styles</b> - for store styles(components)
- <b>Pages</b> - for store main pages of website
- <b>PageStyles</b> - for styles of pages
- <b>Other</b> - for more content of Other page(not finished only sceletons of classes)
- <b>Components</b> - for components that are stored on pages
- <b>Artilces</b> - for components that are pages after redireting on artiles page(for example article in "Zadania")
